## Description
Markdown Previewer is a ReactJS app that uses [markedJS](https://marked.js.org/) to parse markdown to HTML and [hlJS](https://highlightjs.org/) to highlight code syntax.<br/>
Furthermore, it stores the user's session in browser's local storage.<br>
This project was made for FreeCodeCamp's certification [challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).
